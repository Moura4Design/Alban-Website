# Alban-Website
Photography portfolio website built with React.js for client Alban Wagner. Live at [albanwagner.nl](https://albanwagner.nl/).

Project Overview: This photography website was developed for a client during my time as a freelance developer. Built entirely in React.js, the site showcases visual elements like slideshows, image galleries, form cards, and tabbed sections. Several key packages were used to enhance functionality and multilingual support, including:react-photo-gallery, react-translate-component, counterpart, and react-interpolate-component, bootstrap for UI components and responsive layout.

Technologies Used in Node.js: Node.js: Runtime environment for server-side logic. Express: Lightweight framework to manage routes, serve static files, and handle HTTP requests/responses.

Front-End Technologies: React.js: Core framework for building the user interface. Bootstrap 4: For responsive design and UI components. CSS: For custom styling.
